          <p>
          I've had a lifelong interest in computers and technology in general, which eventually led me to take up programming.
          After a period of self-teaching and exploring the opportunities that software engineering can create, I enrolled in the Fullstack Academy immserive program to advance my web development skills.

          <p>
          Previously, I worked in hospitality where I gained invaluable experience and excelled performing in high pressure environments. 
          I enjoyed working with and serving a vastly diverse crowd, as well as taking opportunities to mentor my colleagues.      
          </p>

          <br/>

          <p>
          Technologies I'm proficient with include Javascript and the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node), HTML, and CSS. 
          I am also comfortable with a number of the services offered by Firebase such as Cloud Firestore. 
          Technologies I'm gaining familiarity with include React Native and the ViroReact AR platform.
          </p>

          <br/>

          <p>
          I have many varied interests (music and the arts, travel, food, hospitality) and Iâ€™m excited to apply my programming skills in these areas and beyond.
          My work ethic, attention to detail, and collaborative nature make me a great fit on any engineering team.
